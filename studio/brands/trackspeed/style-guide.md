## Typography

- Modern sans-serif (Inter / SF Pro)
- Headlines: Extra-bold, tight line-height
- Body: Regular weight, comfortable line-height
- Data/times: Monospace, large (48pt+), high contrast — times are the hero
- Sprint data should feel like a scoreboard or timing display

## Content Pillars

1. **Speed Data & Science** — sprint biomechanics, what times mean, acceleration vs top speed
2. **Equipment Disruption** — $0 vs $529 vs $2,000 comparisons, setup speed, portability
3. **Coaching & Testing** — how to run proper speed tests, warm-up protocols, testing day guides
4. **Training Protocols** — sprint workouts, weekly splits, speed development tips
5. **Photo Finish Technology** — how it works, 120fps detection, sub-frame interpolation

## Slide Design Rules

### Text Slides
- Dark charcoal `#191919` or deep blue-gray `#2B2E32` background
- Large bold stats and sprint times in monospace font
- Highlight numbers and data points in Accent Blue `#5C8DB8` or Success Green `#22C55E`
- Clean, minimal — data should breathe
- Safe zones: top 180px, bottom 320px, sides 90px (TikTok 9:16)

### Photo Slides
- Real track/field settings, iPhone-shot aesthetic, natural lighting
- Athletes in motion — sprinting, in blocks, at the line
- No staged studio photos, no stock photo look
- Overlay: dark gradient behind text for readability
- Show the phone/app in real-world context when possible

### Data Slides
- Comparison tables, split time breakdowns, before/after metrics
- Large monospace numbers for times (e.g., "3.24s")
- Color-code improvements in green, regressions in red
- Clean grid layout

### CTA Slides
- Accent Blue `#5C8DB8` background or dark with blue accent
- "Download TrackSpeed — link in bio"
- Show app icon prominently
- Clean, single action

## Tone & Voice

- **Technical but accessible** — "coach explaining to athletes"
- **Data-driven** — always lead with numbers, times, and stats
- **Provocative** — challenge hand-timing culture, question expensive equipment assumptions
- **Confident** — "timing gate accuracy" is a bold, defensible claim
- **Direct** — no fluff, get to the point

## App Icon Overlay

- Position: bottom-right (default), 8% of image width
- Rounded iOS-style corners
- Text label: "trackspeed.app" below icon
- Opacity: 0.18 (subtle watermark)

## Key Stats to Reference

- 120fps camera = 8.3ms frame intervals
- Sub-frame interpolation for sub-millisecond accuracy
- Hand timing error: ~0.24s average
- Photo Finish detection: chest-crossing, not laser-break
- OVR Sprint: $529, laser-based (triggers on any body part)
- Freelap: $500+, wearable chip required
- VALD SmartSpeed: $2,000+, professional gates

## Tricky Words (always spell-check)

- "TrackSpeed" (one word, capital T and S)
- "SprintTimer" (one word, capital S and T)
- "Photo Finish" (two words, both capitalized)
- "trackspeed.app" (lowercase, no space)
- "sub-frame interpolation"
- "millisecond"
