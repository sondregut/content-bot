## Category 1: Equipment & Price Disruption

### 1.1 — "Your Coach's Stopwatch Is Lying To You"

**Sources:** Hand timing error research (~0.24s average), FAT timing standards

**Slide 1** — Hook (photo)
- Micro-label: THE TRUTH
- Headline: Your coach's stopwatch is lying to you
- Body: And it's not even close.
- Highlight: lying to you

**Slide 2** — The data (text)
- Micro-label: THE RESEARCH
- Headline: Hand timing adds an average of 0.24 seconds
- Body: That's the difference between making the team and getting cut. Between a scholarship offer and a rejection letter.
- Highlight: 0.24 seconds

**Slide 3** — Why it happens (text)
- Micro-label: HERE'S WHY
- Headline: Human reaction time can't be eliminated
- Body: Your coach anticipates the start (timer starts early) and reacts late to the finish (timer stops late). The net effect flatters the runner every single time.
- Highlight: flatters the runner

**Slide 4** — The proof (photo)
- Micro-label: WE TESTED IT
- Headline: 10 people timed the same sprint. 10 different results.
- Body: The spread was 0.31 seconds. TrackSpeed's result was the same every time.
- Highlight: 0.31 seconds

**Slide 5** — What this means (text)
- Micro-label: YOUR "4.4" 40
- Headline: Your hand-timed 4.4 is actually a 4.7
- Body: Every college scout knows this. Electronic timing doesn't lie. If you've never been electronically timed, you don't know your real speed.
- Highlight: actually a 4.7

**Slide 6** — The fix (text)
- Micro-label: THE FIX
- Headline: Photo Finish detection. 120fps. Zero human error.
- Body: TrackSpeed uses your iPhone camera to detect the exact frame your chest crosses the line — the same method used in Olympic timing.
- Highlight: Zero human error

**Slide 7** — CTA (text)
- Micro-label: TRACKSPEED
- Headline: Know your real speed.
- Body: Download TrackSpeed — link in bio.
- Highlight: real speed

### 1.2 — "$0 vs $529 vs $2,000 Sprint Timer"

**Sources:** OVR Sprint pricing, VALD SmartSpeed pricing, Freelap pricing

**Slide 1** — Hook (text)
- Micro-label: EQUIPMENT BREAKDOWN
- Headline: $0 vs $529 vs $2,000 sprint timer

- Highlight: $0

**Slide 3** — The mid option (text)
- Micro-label: $529 — OVR SPRINT
- Headline: Laser gates + tripods + carrying case
- Body: Laser break timing — triggers on any body part (arm, knee, hip). Not chest-specific. Setup time: 60+ seconds. Extra gates: $200+ each.
- Highlight: $529

**Slide 4** — The expensive option (text)
- Micro-label: $2,000+ — VALD SMARTSPEED
- Headline: Professional timing gates
- Body: Industry standard for elite programs. Bulky hardware, complex setup, requires dedicated storage. Each additional gate: $400+.

**Slide 5** — Side by side (text)
- Micro-label: THE COMPARISON
- Headline: Same sprint. Three systems. The results?
- Body: Within 0.01-0.02 seconds of each other. The $2,000 system didn't give you $2,000 more accuracy.
- Highlight: 0.01-0.02 seconds

**Slide 6** — The kicker (text)
- Micro-label: PLUS
- Headline: TrackSpeed gives you something they don't
- Body: Video proof. You see the exact frame your chest crossed the line. Laser gates just give you a number — no visual evidence.

## Category 2: Technology & Science

### 2.1 — "How Photo Finish Detection Actually Works"

**Sources:** 120fps camera specs, sub-frame interpolation math, Olympic FAT systems

**Slide 1** — Hook (photo)
- Micro-label: THE TECHNOLOGY
- Headline: How Photo Finish detection actually works
- Body: The same principle used at the Olympics — now in your pocket.
- Highlight: Photo Finish detection

**Slide 2** — Frame rate (text)
- Micro-label: 120 FRAMES PER SECOND
- Headline: Your iPhone captures 120 frames every second
- Body: That's one frame every 8.3 milliseconds. Each frame is a potential finish line crossing.
- Highlight: 120 frames every second

**Slide 3** — Detection (text)
- Micro-label: CHEST DETECTION
- Headline: It looks for your chest — not just any body part
- Body: Laser gates trigger on whatever breaks the beam first — your arm swing, your knee, your hip. TrackSpeed detects your torso crossing, just like real FAT systems.
- Highlight: your chest

**Slide 4** — Interpolation (text)
- Micro-label: SUB-FRAME ACCURACY
- Headline: Then it goes beyond the frame
- Body: Sub-frame interpolation analyzes the pixels between frames to estimate your crossing point to sub-millisecond precision. 8.3ms windows become microsecond estimates.
- Highlight: sub-millisecond precision

**Slide 5** — Stability (text)
- Micro-label: ROCK SOLID
- Headline: IMU stability detection keeps it honest
- Body: The phone's gyroscope monitors movement at 0.35 rad/s threshold. If the phone moves during timing, it tells you. No false readings.
- Highlight: No false readings

**Slide 6** — CTA (text)
- Micro-label: TRACKSPEED
- Headline: Olympic timing technology. In your pocket.
- Body: Download TrackSpeed — link in bio.
- Highlight: In your pocket

### 2.2 — "Your iPhone Camera Is More Accurate Than You Think"

**Sources:** Frame rate math, FAT system comparisons, hand timing error data

**Slide 1** — Hook (photo)
- Micro-label: DID YOU KNOW
- Headline: Your iPhone camera is more accurate than you think
- Body: Way more accurate than a $15 stopwatch.
- Highlight: more accurate than you think

**Slide 2** — The math (text)
- Micro-label: THE NUMBERS
- Headline: 120fps = 8.3ms per frame
- Body: With sub-frame interpolation, TrackSpeed achieves timing precision that rivals $2,000+ professional systems. That's from the phone already in your pocket.
- Highlight: 8.3ms per frame

**Slide 3** — vs hand timing (text)
- Micro-label: VS HAND TIMING
- Headline: Stopwatch error: ~240ms. Camera error: <10ms.
- Body: Human reaction time alone introduces 150-350ms of variability. A 120fps camera has a fixed, consistent 8.3ms window — no reaction time, no bias.
- Highlight: ~240ms vs <10ms

**Slide 4** — vs laser gates (text)
- Micro-label: VS LASER GATES
- Headline: Laser gates: 0.001s accuracy. Camera: 0.001s accuracy.
- Body: The difference? Laser gates cost $529-$2,000+. Your iPhone costs $0 extra. And your camera gives you visual proof — the laser doesn't.
- Highlight: 0.001s accuracy

**Slide 5** — The proof (photo)
- Micro-label: REAL DATA
- Headline: We tested it against Freelap. 20 sprints. Results within 0.02s.

- Highlight: 4-8 weeks

**Slide 5** — The catch (text)
- Micro-label: THE PROBLEM
- Headline: Without timing, you'd never know you improved
- Body: 0.1s is invisible to the naked eye. You can't feel it. Your coach can't see it. Only data shows you the truth.
- Highlight: never know

**Slide 6** — CTA (text)
- Micro-label: TRACKSPEED
- Headline: Measure what matters.
- Body: Download TrackSpeed — link in bio.
